ARCHS4	https://maayanlab.cloud/archs4/	Massive mining of publicly available RNA-seq data from human and mouse	True	DCIC	29636450	10.1038/s41467-018-03751-6	Massive mining of publicly available RNA-seq data from human and mouse	2018-04-10	RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) is the leading technology for genome-wide transcript quantification. However, publicly available RNA-seq data is currently provided mostly in raw form, a significant barrier for global and integrative retrospective analyses. ARCHS4 is a web resource that makes the majority of published RNA-seq data from human and mouse available at the gene and transcript levels. For developing ARCHS4, available FASTQ files from RNA-seq experiments from the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) were aligned using a cloud-based infrastructure. In total 187,946 samples are accessible through ARCHS4 with 103,083 mouse and 84,863 human. Additionally, the ARCHS4 web interface provides intuitive exploration of the processed data through querying tools, interactive visualization, and gene pages that provide average expression across cell lines and tissues, top co-expressed genes for each gene, and predicted biological functions and protein-protein interactions for each gene based on prior knowledge combined with co-expression.

ChIPX Enrichment Analysis 3 ChEA3 is a transcription factor enrichment analysis tool that ranks TFs associated with usersubmitted gene sets. The ChEA3 background database contains a collection of gene set libraries generated from multiple sources including TFgene coexpression from RNAseq studies TFtarget associations from ChIPseq experiments and TFgene cooccurrence computed from crowdsubmitted gene lists. Enrichment results from these distinct sources are integrated to generate a composite rank that improves the prediction of the correct upstream TF compared to ranks produced by individual libraries. We compare ChEA3 with existing TF prediction tools and show that ChEA3 performs better. By integrating the ChEA3 libraries we illuminate general transcription factor properties such as whether the TF behaves as an activator or a repressor.

Drug Gene Budger	http://DGB.cloud	An application for ranking drugs to modulate a specific gene based on transcriptomic signatures.	True	DCIC	30169739	10.1093/bioinformatics/bty763	Drug Gene Budger  DGB : an application for ranking drugs to modulate a specific gene based on transcriptomic signatures.		Mechanistic molecular studies in biomedical research often discover important genes that are aberrantly over- or under-expressed in disease. However  manipulating these genes in an attempt to improve the disease state is challenging. Herein  we reveal Drug Gene Budger  DGB   a web-based and mobile application developed to assist investigators in order to prioritize small molecules that are predicted to maximally influence the expression of their target gene of interest. With DGB  users can enter a gene symbol along with the wish to up-regulate or down-regulate its expression. The output of the application is a ranked list of small molecules that have been experimentally determined to produce the desired expression effect. The table includes log-transformed fold change  P-value and q-value for each small molecule  reporting the significance of differential expression as determined by the limma method. Relevant links are provided to further explore knowledge about the target gene  the small molecule and the source of evidence from which the relationship between the small molecule and the target gene was derived. The experimental data contained within DGB is compiled from signatures extracted from the LINCS L1000 dataset  the original Connectivity Map  CMap  dataset and the Gene Expression Omnibus  GEO . DGB also presents a specificity measure for a drug-gene connection based on the number of genes a drug modulates. DGB provides a useful preliminary technique for identifying small molecules that can target the expression of a single gene in human cells and tissues.

Collections of breast cancer cell lines mirror many of the molecular subtypes and pathways found in tumors, suggesting that treatment of cell lines with candidate therapeutic compounds can guide identification of associations between molecular subtypes, pathways, and drug response. In a test of 77 therapeutic compounds, nearly all drugs showed differential responses across these cell lines, and approximately one third showed subtype-, pathway-, and/or genomic aberration-specific responses. These observations suggest mechanisms of response and resistance and may inform efforts to develop molecular assays that predict clinical response.	PNAS	1091-6490		334.0	506.0	9.0		506.0		3.0

Visualization of these datasets can reveal patterns that may not be obvious by examining the data without such efforts. Here we introduce Drug/Cell-line Browser (DCB), an online interactive HTML5 data visualization tool for interacting with three of the recently published datasets of cancer cell lines/drug-viability studies. DCB uses clustering and canvas visualization of the drugs and the cell lines, as well as a bar graph that summarizes drug effectiveness for the tissue of origin or the cancer subtypes for single or multiple drugs. DCB can help in understanding drug response patterns and prioritizing drug/cancer cell line interactions by tissue of origin or cancer subtype.

Once unbiased lists of genes or proteins are generated from such experiments these lists are used as input for computing enrichment with existing lists created from prior knowledge organized into geneset libraries. While many enrichment analysis tools and geneset libraries databases have been developed there is still room for improvement. Here we present Enrichr an integrative webbased and mobile software application that includes new geneset libraries an alternative approach to rank enriched terms and various interactive visualization approaches to display enrichment results using the JavaScript library Data Driven Documents D3. The software can also be embedded into any tool that performs gene list analysis. We applied Enrichr to analyze nine cancer cell lines by comparing their enrichment signatures to the enrichment signatures of matched normal tissues. We observed a common pattern of up regulation of the polycomb group PRC2 and enrichment for the histone mark H3K27me3 in many cancer cell lines as well as alterations in Tolllike receptor and interlukin signaling in K562 cells when compared with normal myeloid CD33 cells. Such analyses provide global visualization of critical differences between normal tissues and cancer cell lines but can be applied to many other scenarios. Enrichr is an easy to use intuitive enrichment analysis webbased tool providing various types of visualization summaries of collective functions of gene lists.

Such data is deposited into data repositories such as the Gene Expression Omnibus GEO for potential reuse. However these repositories currently do not provide simple interfaces to systematically analyze collections of related studies. Here we present GENE Expression and Enrichment Vector Analyzer GEN3VA a webbased system that enables the integrative analysis of aggregated collections of tagged gene expression signatures identified and extracted from GEO. Each tagged collection of signatures is presented in a report that consists of heatmaps of the differentially expressed genes principal component analysis of all signatures enrichment analysis with several gene set libraries across all signatures which we term enrichment vector analysis and global mapping of small molecules that are predicted to reverse or mimic each signature in the aggregate. We demonstrate how GEN3VA can be used to identify common molecular mechanisms of aging by analyzing tagged signatures from 244 studies that compared young vs. old tissues in mammalian systems. In a second case study we collected 86 signatures from treatment of human cells with dexamethasone a glucocorticoid receptor GR agonist. Our analysis confirms consensus GR target genes and predicts potential drug mimickers. GEN3VA can be used to identify aggregate and analyze themed collections of gene expression signatures from diverse but related studies. Such integrative analyses can be used to address concerns about data reproducibility confirm results across labs and discover new collective knowledge by data reuse.

This leads to an imbalance in research attention where some genes are highly investigated while others are ignored. Geneshot is a search engine developed to illuminate this gap and to promote attention to the understudied genome. Through a simple web interface Geneshot enables researchers to enter arbitrary search terms to receive ranked lists of genes relevant to the search terms. Returned ranked gene lists contain genes that were previously published in association with the search terms as well as genes predicted to be associated with the terms based on data integration from multiple sources. The search results are presented with interactive visualizations. To predict gene function Geneshot utilizes genegene similarity matrices from processed RNAseq data or from genegene cooccurrence data obtained from multiple sources.

The raw expression data from microarray and other highthroughput technologies is deposited into the Gene Expression Omnibus GEO and served as Simple Omnibus Format in Text SOFT files. However to extract and analyze differentially expressed genes from GEO requires significant computational skills. Here we introduce GEO2Enrichr a browser extension for extracting differentially expressed gene sets from GEO and analyzing those sets with Enrichr an independent gene set enrichment analysis tool containing over 70u2009000 annotated gene sets organized into 75 geneset libraries. GEO2Enrichr adds JavaScript code to GEO webpages this code scrapes user selected accession numbers and metadata and then with one click users can submit this information to a webserver application that downloads the SOFT files parses cleans and normalizes the data identifies the differentially expressed genes and then pipes the resulting gene lists to Enrichr for downstream functional analysis. GEO2Enrichr opens a new avenue for adding functionality to major bioinformatics resources such GEO by integrating tools and resources without the need for a plugin architecture. Importantly GEO2Enrichr helps researchers to quickly explore hypotheses with little technical overhead lowering the barrier of entry for biologists by automating data processing steps needed for knowledge extraction from the major repository GEO.

In dividing cells, traditional metrics derived from dose-response curves such as IC 50 , AUC, and E max , are confounded by the number of cell divisions taking place during the assay, which varies widely for biological and experimental reasons. Hafner et al. (Nat Meth 13:521-627, 2016) recently proposed an alternative way to quantify drug response, normalized growth rate (GR) inhibition, that is robust to such confounders. Adoption of the GR method is expected to improve the reproducibility of dose-response assays and the reliability of pharmacogenomic associations (Hafner et al. 500-502, 2017). Results: We describe here an interactive website ( www.grcalculator.org ) for calculation, analysis, and visualization of dose-response data using the GR approach and for comparison of GR and traditional metrics. Data can be user-supplied or derived from published datasets. The web tools are implemented in the form of three integrated Shiny applications (grcalculator, grbrowser, and grtutorial) deployed through a Shiny server. Intuitive graphical user interfaces (GUIs) allow for interactive analysis and visualization of data. The Shiny applications make use of two R packages (shinyLi and GRmetrics) specifically developed for this purpose. The GRmetrics R package is also available via Bioconductor and can be used for offline data analysis and visualization. Source code for the Shiny applications and associated packages (shinyLi and GRmetrics) can be accessed at www.github.com/uc-bd2k/grcalculator and www.github.com/datarail/gr_metrics. Conclusions: GRcalculator is a powerful, user-friendly, and free tool to facilitate analysis of dose-response data. It generates publication-ready figures and provides a unified platform for investigators to analyze dose-response data across diverse cell types and perturbagens (including drugs, biological ligands, RNAi, etc.). GRcalculator also provides access to data collected by the NIH LINCS Program ( http://www.lincsproject.org /) and other public domain datasets. The GRmetrics Bioconductor package provides computationally trained users with a platform for offline analysis of dose-response data and facilitates inclusion of GR metrics calculations within existing R analysis pipelines. These tools are therefore well suited to users in academia as well as industry.	BMC Cancer	1471-2407		23	71	13	0	70 	11 	10	2

For complex computational methods, it is often necessary, not just to recreate the code, but also the software and hardware environment to reproduce results. Virtual machines, and container software such as Docker, make it possible to reproduce the exact environment regardless of the underlying hardware and operating system. However, workflows that use Graphical User Interfaces (GUIs) remain difficult to replicate on different host systems as there is no high level graphical software layer common to all platforms. GUIdock allows for the facile distribution of a systems biology application along with its graphics environment. Complex graphics based workflows, ubiquitous in systems biology, can now be easily exported and reproduced on many different platforms. GUIdock uses Docker, an open source project that provides a container with only the absolutely necessary software dependencies and configures a common X Windows (X11) graphic interface on Linux, Macintosh and Windows platforms. As proof of concept, we present a Docker package that contains a Bioconductor application written in R and C++ called networkBMA for gene network inference. Our package also includes Cytoscape, a java-based platform with a graphical user interface for visualizing and analyzing gene networks, and the CyNetworkBMA app, a Cytoscape app that allows the use of networkBMA via the user-friendly Cytoscape interface.

Such attributes could be physical relationships with other biomolecules expression in cell lines and tissues genetic associations with knockout mouse or human phenotypes or changes in expression after drug treatment. We stored these associations in a relational database along with rich metadata for the genes/proteins their attributes and the original resources. The freely available Harmonizome web portal provides a graphical user interface a web service and a mobile app for querying browsing and downloading all of the collected data. To demonstrate the utility of the Harmonizome we computed and visualized genegene and attributeattribute similarity networks and through unsupervised clustering identified many unexpected relationships by combining pairs of datasets such as the association between kinase perturbations and disease signatures. We also applied supervised machine learning methods to predict novel substrates for kinases endogenous ligands for Gprotein coupled receptors mouse phenotypes for knockout genes and classified unannotated transmembrane proteins for likelihood of being ion channels. The Harmonizome is a comprehensive resource of knowledge about genes and proteins and as such it enables researchers to discover novel relationships between biological entities as well as form novel datadriven hypotheses for experimental validation.Database URL http//amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Harmonizome.

The LINCS Data Portal LDP has been the primary access point for the compendium of LINCS data and has been widely utilized. Here we report the first major update of LDP http//lincsportal.ccs.miami.edu/signatures with substantial changes in the data architecture and APIs a completely redesigned user interface and enhanced curated metadata annotations to support more advanced intuitive and deeper querying exploration and analysis capabilities. The cornerstone of this update has been the decision to reprocess all highlevel LINCS datasets and make them accessible at the data point level enabling users to directly access and download any subset of signatures across the entire library independent from the originating source project or assay. Access to the individual signatures also enables the newly implemented signature search functionality which utilizes the iLINCS platform to identify conditions that mimic or reverse gene set queries. A newly designed query interface enables global metadata search with autosuggest across all annotations associated with perturbations model systems and signatures.

L1000CDS2	https://maayanlab.cloud/L1000CDS2/%23/index	An ultra-fast LINCS L1000 Characteristic Direction signature search engine	True	DCIC	28413689	10.1038/npjsba.2016.15	L1000CDS 2: LINCS L1000 characteristic direction signatures search engine	2016-08-04	The library of integrated network-based cellular signatures (LINCS) L1000 data set currently comprises of over a million gene expression profiles of chemically perturbed human cell lines. Through unique several intrinsic and extrinsic benchmarking schemes, we demonstrate that processing the L1000 data with the characteristic direction (CD) method significantly improves signal to noise compared with the MODZ method currently used to compute L1000 signatures. The CD processed L1000 signatures are served through a state-of-the-art web-based search engine application called L1000CDS2. The L1000CDS2 search engine provides prioritization of thousands of small-molecule signatures, and their pairwise combinations, predicted to either mimic or reverse an input gene expression signature using two methods. The L1000CDS2 search engine also predicts drug targets for all the small molecules profiled by the L1000 assay that we processed. Targets are predicted by computing the cosine similarity between the L1000 small-molecule signatures and a large collection of signatures extracted from the gene expression omnibus (GEO) for single-gene perturbations in mammalian cells. We applied L1000CDS2 to prioritize small molecules that are predicted to reverse expression in 670 disease signatures also extracted from GEO, and prioritized small molecules that can mimic expression of 22 endogenous ligand signatures profiled by the L1000 assay. As a case study, to further demonstrate the utility of L1000CDS2, we collected expression signatures from human cells infected with Ebola virus at 30, 60 and 120 min. Querying these signatures with L1000CDS2 we identified kenpaullone, a GSK3B/CDK2 inhibitor that we show, in subsequent experiments, has a dose-dependent efficacy in inhibiting Ebola infection in vitro without causing cellular toxicity in human cell lines. In summary, the L1000CDS2 tool can be applied in many biological and biomedical settings, while improving the extraction of knowledge from the LINCS L1000 resource.	npj Systems biology and applications	2056-7189		117.0	155.0	9.0		155.0		15.0

This is particularly true when mutation of a single gene is inadequate as a predictor of drug response. The current paper describes a data set of ~600 drug cell line pairs collected as part of the NIH LINCS Program (http://www.lincsproject.org/) in which molecular data (reduced dimensionality transcript L1000 profiles) were recorded across dose and time in parallel with phenotypic data on cellular cytostasis and cytotoxicity. We report that transcriptional and phenotypic responses correlate with each other in general, but whereas inhibitors of chaperones and cell cycle kinases induce similar transcriptional changes across cell lines, changes induced by drugs that inhibit intra-cellular signaling kinases are cell-type specific. In some drug/cell line pairs significant changes in transcription are observed without a change in cell growth or survival; analysis of such pairs identifies drug equivalence classes and, in one case, synergistic drug interactions. In this case, synergy involves cell-type specific suppression of an adaptive drug response.	Nature communications	2041-1723		28.0	136.0	88.0	1.0	136.0		31.0

While most data integration approaches focus on aligning metadata, data integration can be achieved by abstracting experimental results into gene sets. Such gene sets can be made available for reuse through gene set enrichment analysis tools such as Enrichr. Enrichr currently only supports gene sets compiled from human and mouse, limiting accessibility for investigators that study other model organisms. modEnrichr is an expansion of Enrichr for four model organisms: fish, fly, worm and yeast. The gene set libraries within FishEnrichr, FlyEnrichr, WormEnrichr and YeastEnrichr are created from the Gene Ontology, mRNA expression profiles, GeneRIF, pathway databases, protein domain databases and other organism-specific resources. Additionally, libraries were created by predicting gene function from RNA-seq co-expression data processed uniformly from the gene expression omnibus for each organism. The modEnrichr suite of tools provides the ability to convert gene lists across species using an ortholog conversion tool that automatically detects the species. For complex analyses, modEnrichr provides API access that enables submitting batch queries. In summary, modEnrichr leverages existing model organism databases and other resources to facilitate comprehensive hypothesis generation through data integration.

Network2Canvas	http://www.maayanlab.net/N2C	Network visualization on a canvas with enrichment analysis	True	DCIC	23749960	10.1093/bioinformatics/btt319	Network2Canvas network visualization on a canvas with enrichment analysis.	2013-06-07	Networks are vital to computational systems biology research but visualizing them is a challenge. For networks larger than 100 nodes and 200 links ballandstick diagrams fail to convey much information. To address this we developed Network2Canvas N2C a web application that provides an alternative way to view networks. N2C visualizes networks by placing nodes on a square toroidal canvas. The network nodes are clustered on the canvas using simulated annealing to maximize local connections where a nodes brightness is made proportional to its local fitness. The interactive canvas is implemented in HyperText Markup Language HTML5 with the JavaScript library DataDriven Documents D3. We applied N2C to visualize 30 canvases made from human and mouse geneset libraries and 6 canvases made from the Food and Drug Administration FDAapproved drugset libraries. Given lists of genes or drugs enriched terms are highlighted on the canvases and their degree of clustering is computed. Because N2C produces visual patterns of enriched terms on canvases a trained eye can detect signatures instantly. In summary N2C provides a new flexible method to visualize large networks and can be used to perform and visualize geneset and drugset enrichment analyses. N2C is freely available at http//www.maayanlab.net/N2C and is open source. avi.maayanmssm.edu Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

However  inherent biases in high-throughput assays make it difficult to interpret experiments in which more than one type of data is collected. In this work  we introduce Omics Integrator  a software package that takes a variety of  omic  data as input and identifies putative underlying molecular pathways. The approach applies advanced network optimization algorithms to a network of thousands of molecular interactions to find high-confidence  interpretable subnetworks that best explain the data. These subnetworks connect changes observed in gene expression  protein abundance or other global assays to proteins that may not have been measured in the screens due to inherent bias or noise in measurement. This approach reveals unannotated molecular pathways that would not be detectable by searching pathway databases. Omics Integrator also provides an elegant framework to incorporate not only positive data  but also negative evidence. Incorporating negative evidence allows Omics Integrator to avoid unexpressed genes and avoid being biased toward highly-studied hub proteins  except when they are strongly implicated by the data. The software is comprised of two individual tools  Garnet and Forest  that can be run together or independently to allow a user to perform advanced integration of multiple types of high-throughput data as well as create condition-specific subnetworks of protein interactions that best connect the observed changes in various datasets. It is available at http://fraenkel.mit.edu/omicsintegrator and on GitHub at https://github.com/fraenkel-lab/OmicsIntegrator.

The power of this approach lies in its reduction of the dimensionality of the statistical problem and its incorporation of biological interpretation by construction. Many approaches to gene set analysis have been proposed, but benchmarking their performance in the setting of real biological data is difficult due to the lack of a gold standard. In a previously published work we proposed a geometrical approach to differential expression which performed highly in benchmarking tests and compared well to the most popular methods of differential gene expression. As reported, this approach has a natural extension to gene set analysis which we call Principal Angle Enrichment Analysis (PAEA). PAEA employs dimensionality reduction and a multivariate approach for gene set enrichment analysis. However, the performance of this method has not been assessed nor its implementation as a web-based tool. Here we describe new benchmarking protocols for gene set analysis methods and find that PAEA performs highly. The PAEA method is implemented as a user-friendly web-based tool, which contains 70 gene set libraries and is freely available to the community.

However, their system-level analysis has been limited owing to challenges in global metabolite identification. Most metabolite features detected by untargeted metabolomics carried out by liquid-chromatography-mass spectrometry cannot be uniquely identified without additional, time-consuming experiments. We report a network-based approach, prize-collecting Steiner forest algorithm for integrative analysis of untargeted metabolomics (PIUMet), that infers molecular pathways and components via integrative analysis of metabolite features, without requiring their identification. We demonstrated PIUMet by analyzing changes in metabolism of sphingolipids, fatty acids and steroids in a Huntington's disease model. Additionally, PIUMet enabled us to elucidate putative identities of altered metabolite features in diseased cells, and infer experimentally undetected, disease-associated metabolites and dysregulated proteins. Finally, we established PIUMet's ability for integrative analysis of untargeted metabolomics data with proteomics data, demonstrating that this approach elicits disease-associated metabolites and proteins that cannot be inferred by individual analysis of these data.

We profiled signaling pathway activity in a collection of breast cancer cell lines before and after stimulation with physiologically relevant ligands, which revealed the variability in network activity among cells of known genotype and molecular subtype. Despite the receptor-based classification of breast cancer subtypes, we found that the abundance and activity of signaling proteins in unstimulated cells (basal profile), as well as the activity of proteins in stimulated cells (signaling profile), varied within each subtype. Using a partial least-squares regression approach, we constructed models that significantly predicted sensitivity to 23 targeted therapeutics. For example, one model showed that the response to the growth factor receptor ligand heregulin effectively predicted the sensitivity of cells to drugs targeting the cell survival pathway mediated by PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) and Akt, whereas the abundance of Akt or the mutational status of the enzymes in the pathway did not. Thus, basal and signaling protein profiles may yield new biomarkers of drug sensitivity and enable the identification of appropriate therapies in cancers characterized by similar functional dysregulation of signaling networks.

However, using this large and decentralized dataset presents its own challenges. The slinky package was created to streamline the process of identifying samples of interest and their corresponding control samples, and loading their associated expression data and metadata. The package can integrate with workflows leveraging the BioConductor collection of tools by encapsulating the L1000 data as a SummarizedExperiment object.

Multiple libraries are available, but few data-driven approaches exist to compare them and design new libraries. We describe an approach to scoring and creating libraries based on binding selectivity, target coverage, and induced cellular phenotypes as well as chemical structure, stage of clinical development, and user preference. The approach, available via the online tool http://www.smallmoleculesuite.org, assembles sets of compounds with the lowest possible off-target overlap. Analysis of six kinase inhibitor libraries using our approach reveals dramatic differences among them and led us to design a new LSP-OptimalKinase library that outperforms existing collections in target coverage and compact size. We also describe a mechanism of action library that optimally covers 1,852 targets in the liganded genome. Our tools facilitate creation, analysis, and updates of both private and public compound collections.	Cell chemical biology	2451-9448		20.0	73.0			73.0		67.0

Despite extensive efforts, the median survival for GBM patients is approximately 14 months. GBM therapy could benefit greatly from patient-specific targeted therapies that maximize treatment efficacy. Here we report a platform termed SynergySeq to identify drug combinations for the treatment of GBM by integrating information from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and the Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS). We identify differentially expressed genes in GBM samples and devise a consensus gene expression signature for each compound using LINCS L1000 transcriptional profiling data. The SynergySeq platform computes disease discordance and drug concordance to identify combinations of FDA-approved drugs that induce a synergistic response in GBM. Collectively, our studies demonstrate that combining disease-specific gene expression signatures with LINCS small molecule perturbagen-response signatures can identify preclinical combinations for GBM, which can potentially be tested in humans.

We have developed a method called Tied Diffusion Through Interacting Events TieDIE that uses a network diffusion approach to connect genomic perturbations to gene expression changes characteristic of cancer subtypes. The method computes a subnetwork of proteinprotein interactions predicted transcription factortotarget connections and curated interactions from literature that connects genomic and transcriptomic perturbations. Application of TieDIE to The Cancer Genome Atlas and a breast cancer cell line dataset identified key signaling pathways with examples impinging on MYC activity. Interlinking genes are predicted to correspond to essential components of cancer signaling and may provide a mechanistic explanation of tumor character and suggest subtypespecific drug targets. Software is available from the Stuart labs wiki https//sysbiowiki.soe.ucsc.edu/tiedie. jstuartucsc.edu. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

Here, we report more than a 1,000-fold scale-up of the CMap as part of the NIH LINCS Consortium, made possible by a new, low-cost, high-throughput reduced representation expression profiling method that we term L1000. We show that L1000 is highly reproducible, comparable to RNA sequencing, and suitable for computational inference of the expression levels of 81% of non-measured transcripts. We further show that the expanded CMap can be used to discover mechanism of action of small molecules, functionally annotate genetic variants of disease genes, and inform clinical trials. The 1.3 million L1000 profiles described here, as well as tools for their analysis, are available at https://clue.io.	Cell	1097-4172		497.0	1136.0			1136.0	4.0	80.0			
X2K (expression2kinases) Web	http://X2K.cloud	Linking expression signatures to upstream cell signaling networks	True	DCIC	29800326	10.1093/nar/gky458	eXpression2Kinases  X2K  Web: linking expression signatures to upstream cell signaling networks.	2018-05-25	While gene expression data at the mRNA level can be globally and accurately measured  profiling the activity of cell signaling pathways is currently much more difficult. eXpression2Kinases  X2K  computationally predicts involvement of upstream cell signaling pathways  given a signature of differentially expressed genes. X2K first computes enrichment for transcription factors likely to regulate the expression of the differentially expressed genes. The next step of X2K connects these enriched transcription factors through known protein-protein interactions  PPIs  to construct a subnetwork. The final step performs kinase enrichment analysis on the members of the subnetwork. X2K Web is a new implementation of the original eXpression2Kinases algorithm with important enhancements. X2K Web includes many new transcription factor and kinase libraries  and PPI networks. For demonstration  thousands of gene expression signatures induced by kinase inhibitors  applied to six breast cancer cell lines  are provided for fetching directly into X2K Web. The results are displayed as interactive downloadable vector graphic network images and bar graphs. Benchmarking various settings via random permutations enabled the identification of an optimal set of parameters to be used as the default settings in X2K Web. X2K Web is freely available from http://X2K.cloud.
