ChIPX Enrichment Analysis 3 ChEA3 is a transcription factor enrichment analysis tool that ranks TFs associated with usersubmitted gene sets. The ChEA3 background database contains a collection of gene set libraries generated from multiple sources including TFgene coexpression from RNAseq studies TFtarget associations from ChIPseq experiments and TFgene cooccurrence computed from crowdsubmitted gene lists. Enrichment results from these distinct sources are integrated to generate a composite rank that improves the prediction of the correct upstream TF compared to ranks produced by individual libraries. We compare ChEA3 with existing TF prediction tools and show that ChEA3 performs better. By integrating the ChEA3 libraries we illuminate general transcription factor properties such as whether the TF behaves as an activator or a repressor.

Drug Gene Budger	http://DGB.cloud	an application for ranking drugs to modulate a specific gene based on transcriptomic signatures.	2019.0	[30169739]	10.1093/bioinformatics/bty763	Drug Gene Budger  DGB : an application for ranking drugs to modulate a specific gene based on transcriptomic signatures.		Department of Pharmacological Scis	Mechanistic molecular studies in biomedical research often discover important genes that are aberrantly over- or under-expressed in disease. However  manipulating these genes in an attempt to improve the disease state is challenging. Herein  we reveal Drug Gene Budger  DGB   a web-based and mobile application developed to assist investigators in order to prioritize small molecules that are predicted to maximally influence the expression of their target gene of interest. With DGB  users can enter a gene symbol along with the wish to up-regulate or down-regulate its expression. The output of the application is a ranked list of small molecules that have been experimentally determined to produce the desired expression effect. The table includes log-transformed fold change  P-value and q-value for each small molecule  reporting the significance of differential expression as determined by the limma method. Relevant links are provided to further explore knowledge about the target gene  the small molecule and the source of evidence from which the relationship between the small molecule and the target gene was derived. The experimental data contained within DGB is compiled from signatures extracted from the LINCS L1000 dataset  the original Connectivity Map  CMap  dataset and the Gene Expression Omnibus  GEO . DGB also presents a specificity measure for a drug-gene connection based on the number of genes a drug modulates. DGB provides a useful preliminary technique for identifying small molecules that can target the expression of a single gene in human cells and tissues.    The application is freely available on the web at http://DGB.cloud and as a mobile phone application on iTunes https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/drug-gene-budger/id1243580241  mt=8 and Google Play https://play.google.com/store/apps/details  id=com.drgenebudger.

Enrichr	http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Enrichr	Interactive and collaborative HTML5 gene list enrichment analysis tool.	2013.0	[23586463, 27141961]	10.1186/1471-2105-14-128	Enrichr interactive and collaborative HTML5 gene list enrichment analysis tool.	2013-04-15	Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai	Systemwide profiling of genes and proteins in mammalian cells produce lists of differentially expressed genes/proteins that need to be further analyzed for their collective functions in order to extract new knowledge. Once unbiased lists of genes or proteins are generated from such experiments these lists are used as input for computing enrichment with existing lists created from prior knowledge organized into geneset libraries. While many enrichment analysis tools and geneset libraries databases have been developed there is still room for improvement. Here we present Enrichr an integrative webbased and mobile software application that includes new geneset libraries an alternative approach to rank enriched terms and various interactive visualization approaches to display enrichment results using the JavaScript library Data Driven Documents D3. The software can also be embedded into any tool that performs gene list analysis. We applied Enrichr to analyze nine cancer cell lines by comparing their enrichment signatures to the enrichment signatures of matched normal tissues. We observed a common pattern of up regulation of the polycomb group PRC2 and enrichment for the histone mark H3K27me3 in many cancer cell lines as well as alterations in Tolllike receptor and interlukin signaling in K562 cells when compared with normal myeloid CD33 cells. Such analyses provide global visualization of critical differences between normal tissues and cancer cell lines but can be applied to many other scenarios. Enrichr is an easy to use intuitive enrichment analysis webbased tool providing various types of visualization summaries of collective functions of gene lists.

GEN3VA	http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/gen3va	aggregation and analysis of gene expression signatures from related studies.	2016.0	[27846806]		GEN3VA aggregation and analysis of gene expression signatures from related studies.	2016-11-15	Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai	Genomewide gene expression profiling of mammalian cells is becoming a staple of many published biomedical and biological research studies. Such data is deposited into data repositories such as the Gene Expression Omnibus GEO for potential reuse. However these repositories currently do not provide simple interfaces to systematically analyze collections of related studies. Here we present GENE Expression and Enrichment Vector Analyzer GEN3VA a webbased system that enables the integrative analysis of aggregated collections of tagged gene expression signatures identified and extracted from GEO. Each tagged collection of signatures is presented in a report that consists of heatmaps of the differentially expressed genes principal component analysis of all signatures enrichment analysis with several gene set libraries across all signatures which we term enrichment vector analysis and global mapping of small molecules that are predicted to reverse or mimic each signature in the aggregate. We demonstrate how GEN3VA can be used to identify common molecular mechanisms of aging by analyzing tagged signatures from 244 studies that compared young vs. old tissues in mammalian systems. In a second case study we collected 86 signatures from treatment of human cells with dexamethasone a glucocorticoid receptor GR agonist. Our analysis confirms consensus GR target genes and predicts potential drug mimickers. GEN3VA can be used to identify aggregate and analyze themed collections of gene expression signatures from diverse but related studies. Such integrative analyses can be used to address concerns about data reproducibility confirm results across labs and discover new collective knowledge by data reuse. GEN3VA is an opensource webbased system that is freely available at http//amp.pharm.mssm.edu/gen3va .	BMC bioinformatics	1471-2105	HL127624
Geneshot	https://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/geneshot	search engine for ranking genes from arbitrary text queries.	2019.0	[31114885]	10.1093/nar/gkz393	Geneshot search engine for ranking genes from arbitrary text queries.	2019-05-22	Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai	The frequency by which genes are studied correlates with the prior knowledge accumulated about them. This leads to an imbalance in research attention where some genes are highly investigated while others are ignored. Geneshot is a search engine developed to illuminate this gap and to promote attention to the understudied genome. Through a simple web interface Geneshot enables researchers to enter arbitrary search terms to receive ranked lists of genes relevant to the search terms. Returned ranked gene lists contain genes that were previously published in association with the search terms as well as genes predicted to be associated with the terms based on data integration from multiple sources. The search results are presented with interactive visualizations. To predict gene function Geneshot utilizes genegene similarity matrices from processed RNAseq data or from genegene cooccurrence data obtained from multiple sources. In addition Geneshot can be used to analyze the novelty of gene sets and augment gene sets with additional relevant genes.xa0The Geneshot webserver and API are freely and openly available from https//amp.pharm.mssm.edu/geneshot.

The raw expression data from microarray and other highthroughput technologies is deposited into the Gene Expression Omnibus GEO and served as Simple Omnibus Format in Text SOFT files. However to extract and analyze differentially expressed genes from GEO requires significant computational skills. Here we introduce GEO2Enrichr a browser extension for extracting differentially expressed gene sets from GEO and analyzing those sets with Enrichr an independent gene set enrichment analysis tool containing over 70u2009000 annotated gene sets organized into 75 geneset libraries. GEO2Enrichr adds JavaScript code to GEO webpages this code scrapes user selected accession numbers and metadata and then with one click users can submit this information to a webserver application that downloads the SOFT files parses cleans and normalizes the data identifies the differentially expressed genes and then pipes the resulting gene lists to Enrichr for downstream functional analysis. GEO2Enrichr opens a new avenue for adding functionality to major bioinformatics resources such GEO by integrating tools and resources without the need for a plugin architecture. Importantly GEO2Enrichr helps researchers to quickly explore hypotheses with little technical overhead lowering the barrier of entry for biologists by automating data processing steps needed for knowledge extraction from the major repository GEO.

GRcalculator	http://www.lincsproject.org	an online tool for calculating and mining doseresponse data.	2017.0	[29065900]	10.1186/s12885-017-3689-3	GRcalculator an online tool for calculating and mining doseresponse data.	2017-10-24	Uni of Cincinnati	Quantifying the response of cell lines to drugs or other perturbagens is the cornerstone of preclinical drug development and pharmacogenomics as well as a means to study factors that contribute to sensitivity and resistance. In dividing cells traditional metrics derived from doseresponse curves such as IC 50  AUC and E max  are confounded by the number of cell divisions taking place during the assay which varies widely for biological and experimental reasons. Hafner et al. Nat Meth 13521627 2016 recently proposed an alternative way to quantify drug response normalized growth rate GR inhibition that is robust to such confounders. Adoption of the GR method is expected to improve the reproducibility of doseresponse assays and the reliability of pharmacogenomic associations Hafner et al. 500502 2017. We describe here an interactive website  www.grcalculator.org  for calculation analysis and visualization of doseresponse data using the GR approach and for comparison of GR and traditional metrics. Data can be usersupplied or derived from published datasets. The web tools are implemented in the form of three integrated Shiny applications grcalculator grbrowser and grtutorial deployed through a Shiny server. Intuitive graphical user interfaces GUIs allow for interactive analysis and visualization of data. The Shiny applications make use of two R packages shinyLi and GRmetrics specifically developed for this purpose. The GRmetrics R package is also available via Bioconductor and can be used for offline data analysis and visualization. Source code for the Shiny applications and associated packages shinyLi and GRmetrics can be accessed at www.github.com/ucbd2k/grcalculator and www.github.com/datarail/gr_metrics . GRcalculator is a powerful userfriendly and free tool to facilitate analysis of doseresponse data. It generates publicationready figures and provides a unified platform for investigators to analyze doseresponse data across diverse cell types and perturbagens including drugs biological ligands RNAi etc.. GRcalculator also provides access to data collected by the NIH LINCS Program  http//www.lincsproject.org / and other public domain datasets. The GRmetrics Bioconductor package provides computationally trained users with a platform for offline analysis of doseresponse data and facilitates inclusion of GR metrics calculations within existing R analysis pipelines. These tools are therefore well suited to users in academia as well as industry.	BMC cancer	1471-2407	HL127365

Harmonizome	http://amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Harmonizome	a collection of processed datasets gathered to serve and mine knowledge about genes and proteins.	2016.0	[27374120]		The harmonizome a collection of processed datasets gathered to serve and mine knowledge about genes and proteins.	2016-07-03	Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai	Genomics epigenomics transcriptomics proteomics and metabolomics efforts rapidly generate a plethora of data on the activity and levels of biomolecules within mammalian cells. At the same time curation projects that organize knowledge from the biomedical literature into online databases are expanding. Hence there is a wealth of information about genes proteins and their associations with an urgent need for data integration to achieve better knowledge extraction and data reuse. For this purpose we developed the Harmonizome a collection of processed datasets gathered to serve and mine knowledge about genes and proteins from over 70 major online resources. We extracted abstracted and organized data into 72 million functional associations between genes/proteins and their attributes. Such attributes could be physical relationships with other biomolecules expression in cell lines and tissues genetic associations with knockout mouse or human phenotypes or changes in expression after drug treatment. We stored these associations in a relational database along with rich metadata for the genes/proteins their attributes and the original resources. The freely available Harmonizome web portal provides a graphical user interface a web service and a mobile app for querying browsing and downloading all of the collected data. To demonstrate the utility of the Harmonizome we computed and visualized genegene and attributeattribute similarity networks and through unsupervised clustering identified many unexpected relationships by combining pairs of datasets such as the association between kinase perturbations and disease signatures. We also applied supervised machine learning methods to predict novel substrates for kinases endogenous ligands for Gprotein coupled receptors mouse phenotypes for knockout genes and classified unannotated transmembrane proteins for likelihood of being ion channels. The Harmonizome is a comprehensive resource of knowledge about genes and proteins and as such it enables researchers to discover novel relationships between biological entities as well as form novel datadriven hypotheses for experimental validation.Database URL http//amp.pharm.mssm.edu/Harmonizome.

The LINCS Data Portal LDP has been the primary access point for the compendium of LINCS data and has been widely utilized. Here we report the first major update of LDP http//lincsportal.ccs.miami.edu/signatures with substantial changes in the data architecture and APIs a completely redesigned user interface and enhanced curated metadata annotations to support more advanced intuitive and deeper querying exploration and analysis capabilities. The cornerstone of this update has been the decision to reprocess all highlevel LINCS datasets and make them accessible at the data point level enabling users to directly access and download any subset of signatures across the entire library independent from the originating source project or assay. Access to the individual signatures also enables the newly implemented signature search functionality which utilizes the iLINCS platform to identify conditions that mimic or reverse gene set queries. A newly designed query interface enables global metadata search with autosuggest across all annotations associated with perturbations model systems and signatures.

For networks larger than 100 nodes and 200 links ballandstick diagrams fail to convey much information. To address this we developed Network2Canvas N2C a web application that provides an alternative way to view networks. N2C visualizes networks by placing nodes on a square toroidal canvas. The network nodes are clustered on the canvas using simulated annealing to maximize local connections where a nodes brightness is made proportional to its local fitness. The interactive canvas is implemented in HyperText Markup Language HTML5 with the JavaScript library DataDriven Documents D3. We applied N2C to visualize 30 canvases made from human and mouse geneset libraries and 6 canvases made from the Food and Drug Administration FDAapproved drugset libraries. Given lists of genes or drugs enriched terms are highlighted on the canvases and their degree of clustering is computed. Because N2C produces visual patterns of enriched terms on canvases a trained eye can detect signatures instantly. In summary N2C provides a new flexible method to visualize large networks and can be used to perform and visualize geneset and drugset enrichment analyses. N2C is freely available at http//www.maayanlab.net/N2C and is open source. avi.maayanmssm.edu Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

Department of Biological Engineering	High-throughput   omic  methods provide sensitive measures of biological responses to perturbations. However  inherent biases in high-throughput assays make it difficult to interpret experiments in which more than one type of data is collected. In this work  we introduce Omics Integrator  a software package that takes a variety of  omic  data as input and identifies putative underlying molecular pathways. The approach applies advanced network optimization algorithms to a network of thousands of molecular interactions to find high-confidence  interpretable subnetworks that best explain the data. These subnetworks connect changes observed in gene expression  protein abundance or other global assays to proteins that may not have been measured in the screens due to inherent bias or noise in measurement. This approach reveals unannotated molecular pathways that would not be detectable by searching pathway databases. Omics Integrator also provides an elegant framework to incorporate not only positive data  but also negative evidence. Incorporating negative evidence allows Omics Integrator to avoid unexpressed genes and avoid being biased toward highly-studied hub proteins  except when they are strongly implicated by the data. The software is comprised of two individual tools  Garnet and Forest  that can be run together or independently to allow a user to perform advanced integration of multiple types of high-throughput data as well as create condition-specific subnetworks of protein interactions that best connect the observed changes in various datasets.

PiNET	http://pinet-server.org	a versatile web platform for downstream analysis and visualization of proteomics data.	2020.0	[32469073]		piNET a versatile web platform for downstream analysis and visualization of proteomics data.	2020-07-02	Uni of Cincinnati College of Medicine	Rapid progress in proteomics and largescale profiling of biological systems at the protein level necessitates the continued development of efficient computational tools for the analysis and interpretation of proteomics data. Here we present the piNET server that facilitates integrated annotation analysis and visualization of quantitative proteomics data with emphasis on PTM networks and integration with the LINCS library of chemical and genetic perturbation signatures in order to provide further mechanistic and functional insights. The primary input for the server consists of a set of peptides or proteins optionally with PTM sites and their corresponding abundance values. Several interconnected workflows can be used to generate i interactive graphs and tables providing comprehensive annotation and mapping between peptides and proteins with PTM sites ii high resolution and interactive visualization for enzymesubstrate networks including kinases and their phosphopeptide targets iii mapping and visualization of LINCS signature connectivity for chemical inhibitors or genetic knockdown of enzymes upstream of their target PTM sites. piNET has been built using a modular SpringBoot JAVA platform as a fast versatile and easy to use tool. The Apache Lucene indexing is used for fast mapping of peptides into UniProt entries for the human mouse and other commonly used model organism proteomes. PTMcentric network analyses combine PhosphoSitePlus iPTMnet and SIGNOR databases of validated enzymesubstrate relationships for kinase networks augmented by DeepPhos predictions and sequencebased mapping of PhosphoSitePlus consensus motifs. Concordant LINCS signatures are mapped using iLINCS. For each workflow a RESTful API counterpart can be used to generate the results programmatically in the json format. The server is available at http//pinetserver.org and it is free and open to all users without login requirement.	Nucleic acids research	1362-4962	HL127624

Department of Pharmacology and Systems Therapeutics	Adverse drug reactions  ADRs  are a central consideration during drug development. Here we present a machine learning classifier to prioritize ADRs for approved drugs and pre-clinical small-molecule compounds by combining chemical structure  CS  and gene expression  GE  features. The GE data is from the Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures  LINCS  L1000 dataset that measured changes in GE before and after treatment of human cells with over 20 000 small-molecule compounds including most of the FDA-approved drugs. Using various benchmarking methods  we show that the integration of GE data with the CS of the drugs can significantly improve the predictability of ADRs. Moreover  transforming GE features to enrichment vectors of biological terms further improves the predictive capability of the classifiers. The most predictive biological-term features can assist in understanding the drug mechanisms of action. Finally  we applied the classifier to all  u2009 20 000 small-molecules profiled  and developed a web portal for browsing and searching predictive small-molecule/ADR connections.    The interface for the adverse event predictions for the  u2009 20 000 LINCS compounds is available at http://maayanlab.net/SEP-L1000/ CONTACT: avi.maayan mssm.edu    Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

We have developed a method called Tied Diffusion Through Interacting Events TieDIE that uses a network diffusion approach to connect genomic perturbations to gene expression changes characteristic of cancer subtypes. The method computes a subnetwork of proteinprotein interactions predicted transcription factortotarget connections and curated interactions from literature that connects genomic and transcriptomic perturbations. Application of TieDIE to The Cancer Genome Atlas and a breast cancer cell line dataset identified key signaling pathways with examples impinging on MYC activity. Interlinking genes are predicted to correspond to essential components of cancer signaling and may provide a mechanistic explanation of tumor character and suggest subtypespecific drug targets. Software is available from the Stuart labs wiki https//sysbiowiki.soe.ucsc.edu/tiedie. jstuartucsc.edu. Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

X2K (expression2kinases) Web	http://X2K.cloud	linking expression signatures to upstream cell signaling networks.	2018.0	[29800326]	10.1093/nar/gky458	eXpression2Kinases  X2K  Web: linking expression signatures to upstream cell signaling networks.		DBD2K-LINCS Data Coordination and Integration Center; Knowledge Management Center for the Illuminating the Druggable Genome; Department of Pharmacological Scis	While gene expression data at the mRNA level can be globally and accurately measured  profiling the activity of cell signaling pathways is currently much more difficult. eXpression2Kinases  X2K  computationally predicts involvement of upstream cell signaling pathways  given a signature of differentially expressed genes. X2K first computes enrichment for transcription factors likely to regulate the expression of the differentially expressed genes. The next step of X2K connects these enriched transcription factors through known protein-protein interactions  PPIs  to construct a subnetwork. The final step performs kinase enrichment analysis on the members of the subnetwork. X2K Web is a new implementation of the original eXpression2Kinases algorithm with important enhancements. X2K Web includes many new transcription factor and kinase libraries  and PPI networks. For demonstration  thousands of gene expression signatures induced by kinase inhibitors  applied to six breast cancer cell lines  are provided for fetching directly into X2K Web. The results are displayed as interactive downloadable vector graphic network images and bar graphs. Benchmarking various settings via random permutations enabled the identification of an optimal set of parameters to be used as the default settings in X2K Web. X2K Web is freely available from http://X2K.cloud.	Nucleic acids research	1362-4962	CA224260
