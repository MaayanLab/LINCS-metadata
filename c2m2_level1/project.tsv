http://www.lincsproject.org/	LINCS	http://www.lincsproject.org/		LINCS	Library of Integrated Network-based Cellular Signatures	The Library of Integrated Network-Based Cellular Signatures (LINCS) Program aims to create a network-based understanding of biology by cataloging changes in gene expression and other cellular processes that occur when cells are exposed to a variety of perturbing agents.
http://www.lincsproject.org/	LINCS phase 2				LINCS phase 2	The LINCS Consortium is an NIH Common Fund program that supports six Data and Signature Generation Centers (DSGCs) and the BD2K-LINCS Data Integration and Coordination Center. The LINCS program is currently in phase II after the completion of pilot phase I in fiscal year 2013.
http://www.lincsproject.org/	LINCS phase 1				LINCS phase 1	"The LINCS Pilot Phase I was composed of 10 centers: two data production/analysis centers, that generated data for the LINCS matrix, four centers dedicated to developing technology to complement and facilitate the collection of cellular signatures, and four centers that developed computational tools for analyzing the data produced by the data production centers. In addition, two external supplements, as well as a number of internal collaborations, supported and augmented the work done by the LINCS centers."
http://www.lincsproject.org/	External				External	"External datasets from entities outside the six LINCS DSGCs, including data curated from ChEMBL, Tox21, diversity-oriented synthesis activities at the Broad Institute for the Science of Therapeutics, and  the Molecular Libraries Small-Molecule Repository."
http://www.lincsproject.org/	LINCS MCF10A project				LINCS MCF10A project	"The NIH LINCS Consortium has been working on a Common Project to systematically characterize human cell response to perturbation by gene disruption, small molecules, and components of the microenvironment. An initial focus of this Common Project has been work with the human breast cell line MCF 10A. Data includes both fixed-time-point and rolling-time-point sensitivity measures of MCF 10A to 8 small molecule perturbagens, as well as highly-multiplexed imaging via Cyclic Immunofluorescence (CycIF) of protein levels and protein phosphorylation states."
http://www.lincsproject.org/	LINCS joint project				LINCS joint project	"The LINCS Pilot Phase Joint Project developed transcriptional profiles of cultured human breast cancer cell lines treated with small molecules: 5 different human breast cancer cell lines were treated with 109 small molecules, with the expression of 978 representative genes measured. "

The LINCS Center for Transcriptomics at the Broad Institute uses the L1000 high-throughput gene-expression assay to build a Connectivity Map which seeks to enable the discovery of functional connections between drugs, genes and diseases through analysis of patterns induced by common gene-expression changes."

P100 monitors ~100 phosphorylated peptides from cellular proteins that serve as a reduced representation of the phosphoproteome. GCP monitors ~60 modified peptides from histones (e.g., methylated, acetylated, and combinations thereof) encompassing nearly every well-studied post-translational modification on the core nucleosomal histone proteins. Closely complementing these assays is the L1000 high-throughput gene-expression assay."
