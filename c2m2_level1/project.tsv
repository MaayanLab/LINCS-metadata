The LINCS Center for Transcriptomics at the Broad Institute uses the L1000 high-throughput gene-expression assay to build a Connectivity Map which seeks to enable the discovery of functional connections between drugs, genes and diseases through analysis of patterns induced by common gene-expression changes.

The LINCS Center for Transcriptomics at the Broad Institute uses the L1000 high-throughput gene-expression assay to build a Connectivity Map which seeks to enable the discovery of functional connections between drugs, genes and diseases through analysis of patterns induced by common gene-expression changes. These files represent L1000 data generated during the LINCS Pilot Phase (2012-2015), as well as profiles generated for more specific purposes, such as assay development and validation projects or testing custom compounds or non-standard cell lines.

The LINCS PCCSE uses two high-throughput liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LCMS) assays to study the proteomic changes induced by drug and genetic perturbations. P100 monitors ~100 phosphorylated peptides from cellular proteins that serve as a reduced representation of the phosphoproteome. GCP monitors ~60 modified peptides from histones (e.g., methylated, acetylated, and combinations thereof) encompassing nearly every well-studied post-translational modification on the core nucleosomal histone proteins. Closely complementing these assays is the L1000 high-throughput gene-expression assay.

The LINCS Center for Transcriptomics at the Broad Institute uses the L1000 high-throughput gene-expression assay to profile a range of cellular models and perturbations of cellular state. These data relate to using RNA-Seq datasets from the GTEx consortium to validate the L1000 assay and to improve the statistical model used in imputing the transcriptome.
