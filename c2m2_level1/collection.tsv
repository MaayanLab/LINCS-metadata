Profiles were measured for ~18,000 compounds derived from diversity-oriented synthesis activities at the Broad Institute Center for the Science of Therapeutics, ~10,000 compounds selected from the Molecular Libraries Small-Molecule Repository (MLSMR), and ~2,000 known bioactive compounds. Each of the three subsets was selected to be structurally diverse. MLSMR compounds were further selected to have diverse biological performance. Imaging profiles were measured for a total of ~30,000 compounds. We used a \""cell-painting\"" assay to stain seven major cellular components with fluorescent dyes followed by automatic image capture and analysis to extract shape, texture, and intensity parameters. The imaging assay protocol has been published by Gustafsdottir SM et al. L1000 profiles were measured for ~20,000 compounds. All experiments were performed with U-2 OS cells. Among other activities, we have analyzed these data using cheminformatics approaches to derive structure-based associations with patterns of performance in the profiles. The generation of this dataset was supported by the Molecular Libraries Program of the National Institutes of Health (U54-HG005032). Data made available as part of this project includes L1000 data and image-based cell-morphology profiles for small-molecule perturbations.

A key aim of DToxS is to generate both proteomic and transcriptomic signatures that cab predict adverse effects, especially cardiotoxicity, of drugs approved by the Food and Drug Administration. Towards this goal, high throughput shot-gun proteomics experiments (317 cell line/drug combinations + 64 HeLa control lysates) have been conducted at the Center for Advanced Proteomics Research at Rutgers-New Jersey Medical School. The integrated proteomic and transcriptomic signatures have been used for computational network analysis to identify cellular signatures of cardiotoxicity that may predict drug-induced toxicity and possible mitigation of such toxicities by mixing different drugs. Both raw and processed proteomics data have been carefully controlled for quality and have been made publicly available via the PRoteomics IDEntifications (PRIDE) database. As such, this broad drug-stimulated proteomic dataset is valuable for the prediction drug toxicities and their mitigation.
